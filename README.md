# 🤖 Persona-Adaptive AI Support Agent

An intelligent AI-powered customer support assistant built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **persona-aware response generation**, and **human escalation detection**.

This system dynamically adapts its responses based on different customer personas such as:

* 😡 Frustrated Users
* 👨‍💻 Technical Experts
* 💼 Business Executives

The assistant retrieves relevant information from a custom SaaS knowledge base and generates context-aware responses using modern LLM orchestration techniques.

# 📌 Project Overview

Traditional support bots provide generic responses regardless of customer behavior or context.

This project solves that problem by combining:

* Persona Classification
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Vector Search
* Escalation Intelligence
* Adaptive Response Generation

The result is an AI support assistant capable of delivering personalized, context-aware customer support experiences.

# ✨ Features

## 🧠 Persona Detection

Automatically classifies customer queries into:

* Technical Expert
* Frustrated User
* Business Executive

and adapts response tone dynamically.

---

## 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The system retrieves relevant knowledge-base articles before generating responses.

This improves:

* factual grounding
* response relevance
* hallucination reduction

---

## 🗂️ Chroma Vector Database

Uses vector embeddings for semantic document retrieval.

Supports:

* similarity search
* semantic matching
* scalable retrieval pipelines

---

## ⚠️ Escalation Detection

Automatically recommends human escalation for:

* billing disputes
* security concerns
* payment failures
* low-confidence retrieval
* frustrated customer behavior

## 💬 Adaptive AI Responses

Different users receive different response styles:

| Persona            | Response Style         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Technical Expert   | Detailed & technical   |
| Frustrated User    | Calm & empathetic      |
| Business Executive | Concise & professional |

---

## 🌐 Interactive Streamlit UI

Modern SaaS-style interface with:

* AI response generation
* retrieved knowledge sources
* escalation alerts
* sample testing prompts
